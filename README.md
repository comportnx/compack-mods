# COMPACK Mod Collection

Mods included in this pack:

### Tough Tyres

In reality, a lot of heavy duty off-road vehicles like tractors use foam-filled or non-pneumatic tyres to eliminate the risk of punctures.

This mod makes wide off-road tyres (found on tractors, 4x4 trucks, and excavators) heavier, but immune to punctures.

### Quiet Riots

Disables riot damage for buildings (but not roads).
