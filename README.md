# COMPACK Mod Collection

Mods included in this pack:

### Tough Tyres

`Off-road wide wheels are immune to punctures`

In reality, a lot of heavy duty off-road vehicles like tractors use foam-filled or semi-pneumatic tyres to eliminate the risk of punctures.

This mod replacies off-road wide wheels with off-road no-flat wheels, which are heavier but immune to punctures. Found on tractors, trenchers, and excavators.

### Fast Pulping

`(a)ctivating a sledgehammer pulps nearby corpses`

Gives sledgehammers and heavy sledgehammers an (a)ctivatable ability that pulps surrounding corpses. Using the ability takes 10 seconds and some stamina.

### Quiet Riots

`Disables riot damage`

Disables riot damage for buildings (but not roads).
