# Tough Tyres

A lot of heavy duty off-road vehicles like tractors use foam-filled or non-pneumatic tyres to reduce the risk of punctures.

This mod makes wide off-road tyres (found on tractors and 4x4 trucks) heavier, but immune to punctures.

In reality, tyres like this would overheat if driven too fast, but CDDA doesn't model tyre heat.
